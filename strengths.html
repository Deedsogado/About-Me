	 <tr>
	 <td class="attribute" rowspan="2">Restorative</td>
	 <td><p>People who are especially talented in the Restorative theme are adept at dealing with problems.  They are good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it. </p>
	 <p>The Genius of Restorative Talents is in your love of Problems. While others shy away, your solution-oriented mind naturally gravitates toward these challenges.</p></td>
	 </tr><tr>
	 <td class="example"><p>My restorative strength manifests itself frequently when I fix things, such as computers. Recently I have repaired the monitor on a coworker's laptop, as well as fixed a friend's computer from a bad power connection. </p></td>
	 </tr>
	 
	 <tr>
	 <td class="attribute" rowspan="2">Strategic</td>
	 <td><p>People who are especially talented in the Strategic theme create alternative ways to proceed.  Faced with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues. </p>
	 <p>The genius of Strategic talents is found in your ability to quickly weigh various alternative paths and determine the one that will work best and most efficiently.  Sometimes you think backwards--visualizing the outcome you want and then generating multiple ways of reaching that goal.</p></td>
	 </tr><tr>
	 <td class="example"><p>When I am faced with a new challenge, I usually brainstorm several alternative solutions and then eliminate choices based on what those solutions would entail. This becomes evident to anyone who I tutor, as I give them several different paths to take to answer a question, and let them choose which one they think is best. </p></td>
	 </tr>
	 
	 <tr>
	 <td class="attribute" rowspan="2">Relator</td>
	 <td><p>People who are especially talented in the Relator theme enjoy close relationships with others. They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to acheive a goal.</p>
	 <p>The genius of Relator talents is in your ability to form solid, mutually rewarding relationships.</p></td>
	 </tr><tr>
	 <td class="example"><p>I'm not a social butterfly. I'm not good at keeping up with hundreds of contacts.  Instead of wasting energies doing that, I would rather have a small handful of good friends, who I know will have my back. </p></td>
	 </tr>
	 
	 <tr>
	 <td class="attribute" rowspan="2">Learner</td>
	 <td><p>People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve.  In particluar, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.</p> 
	 <p>The genius of Learner talents is that you not only love to learn; you also intuitively know how you learn best.</p></td>
	 </tr><tr>
	 <td class="example"><p>My Learner strength manifests in the form of reading how-to articles on the internet such as at <a href="http://howtogeek.com">howtogeek.com</a>.</p></td>
	 </tr>
	 
	 <tr>
	 <td class="attribute" rowspan="2">Intellection</td>
	 <td><p>People who are especially talented in the Intellection theme are characterized by their intellectual activity.  They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.</p> 
	 <p>The genius of Intellection talents streams from the deep processing that occurs when you think. Wisdom and clarity result from your ability to muse for long periods of time.</p></td>
	 </tr><tr>
	 <td class="example"><p>This strength lends to deep pondering, where I try to discover patterns and relationships between things I've recently learned and how to apply them to things I already new. Because of this, while I may not remember the lesson verbatim, I at  least remember how to apply the key principles.</p></td>
