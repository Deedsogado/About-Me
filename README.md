## Notes

While I wrote the code from scratch, I got the layout design of the wavy header and footer from a sample exercise I saw years ago in my high school HTML course. The mechanics of the CSS had to be entirely reworked in order to get the footer and article to stay in the correct places when zooming in and out.  I have another version that doesn't require the 6 `<br />` tags to keep the article from falling behind by the header and footer, but on shorter pages like Short Bio, the footer leaves the bottom of the screen, while the banner stays there, making everything look out of place. I'm not happy with the need to have breaks, as I really want to seperate content from presentation, but this is the version that actually works.
