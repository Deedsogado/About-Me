	  <p>I am a student attending the LDS Business College in Salt Lake city, studying Information Technology. I am from a small town about 50 miles northwest of Boise, ID, where I lived for 19 years. I have always been skilled with computers, and hope to get a job in the IT field, though I haven't decided exactly what I want to do.</p>

      <p>I am a huge fan of webcomics and cartoons, and I enjoy reading articles about computers and culture in general. Naturally, one of my favorite comics is Xkcd.  I can attribute a lot of my success in computers to Chris Hoffman, the head writer at howtogeek.com, from whom I learned windows inside and out, and a lot about GNU/linux.</p>
